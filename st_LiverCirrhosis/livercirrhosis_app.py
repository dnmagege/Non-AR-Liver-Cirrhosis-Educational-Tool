        The liver is like the bodyâ€™s superhero, as it operates backstage and works for keeping you alive and healthy. It performs an array of tasks from system detoxification to the generation of digestive-friendly bile, storage, and regulation of energy levels, and hormone control.
        
        It is, in addition, one of the very few organs in the body that can rejuvenate on their own. A healthy liver performs so many life-carrying functions within the body, from immunity to blood clotting - in other words, a happy liver equates to a happy body.
        
        However, not all livers stay healthy. Liver cirrhosis is a disease of progressive deterioration of the liver due to long-term damage. In advanced stages, cirrhosis may lead to liver failure or even liver cancer and is capable of causing death. A liver transplant is very often the only curative option at this stage for most people.
        
        Fortunately, lifestyle changes and certain medications can help slow the progression of cirrhosis in some people and even reverse a part of the damage in some. It is very critical to take proper steps toward protection and care for one's liver, so it continues being the superhero of the body.

        Liver cirrhosis is a condition in which the liver is damaged to the extent that scar tissue replaces the healthy tissues. Think of it as a factory in which the machines break down and, in turn, get replaced by pieces that just don't work.
        
        This buildup of scar tissue in the liver makes it harder and harder for the liver to perform its functions, whether it is filtering toxins from the blood or digesting nutrients. This might lead to all sorts of complications and might even affect the functioning of the liver if not checked. Causes usually include chronic alcohol intake, fatty liver diseases, and hepatitis infection.
        
        External Appearance: The cirrhotic liver is shrunken, coarse, and nodular, due to extensive scarring. The outer layer is rough and might be covered with bumps rose by the occurrence of regenerative nodules surrounded by fibrotic tissue.
        
        Internal Changes: Healthy, smooth liver tissue is replaced with fibrous scar tissue. Blood flow through the liver outflows and leads to portal hypertension-high pressure in the liver blood vessels.
        
        Color: The liver may appear dull and pale or yellowish or greenish, depending on the degree of impairment of bile flow, particularly in advanced cases.

        1. Fatigue and Weakness: This is poor nutrient processing and it occurs when there is accumulation of wastes in the body.

        2. Loss of Appetite and Weight: This is generally associated with nausea or vomiting.

        3. Yellow skin and eyes (jaundice): This is when liver is unable to process bilirubin in the way it should.

        4. Itchy skin or easy bruising: This is when the liver is less able to help the blood to clot.

        5. Cognitive Problems: Hepatic encephalopathy (accumulation of toxins in the brain) may lead to confusion and difficulties in concentration.

        6. Swelling: Fluid can build up in the abdomen (ascites) or legs (edema).

        Some complications can be quite serious, including:

        7. Bleeding in the stomach or esophagus: This is from increased pressure in the liver due to enlarged veins called varices.

        8. Predisposition to Infections: The body is more prone to infections due to a weak response from the immune system.

        The most advanced stage is the decompensated one, and is known as:

        4. Cirrhosis: This is when the liver starts its failure. It becomes symptomatic, with symptoms such as jaundice and complications like ascites, the accumulation of fluid in the abdomen.

        Fatty liver, or steatosis, is the abnormal accumulation of fat tissue within the liver cells. This represents the earliest and mildest form of the liver disorder, and for long periods, it usually doesn't cause any harm. 
        But often, it may also be a starting point that progresses via fibrosis to cirrhosis.

        The liver is enlarged with pale and greasy masses of fat.
        Microscopically, fat vacuoles accumulate inside liver cells, pushing the nucleus to the edge.

        Fatty liver may arise from the following: 

        NAFLD or Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: It is related to obesity, high cholesterol, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. 

        AFLD or Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: The causes include the intake of alcohol in large amounts.

        Rapid weight loss, malnutrition, certain medications, or toxins.

        Fibrosis refers to the scarring of liver tissue resulting from chronic injury or inflammation. While fatty liver consists mainly of an accumulation of fat, in the case of fibrosis, structural damage to the liver is depicted. 
        It means the liver is trying to heal itself but is making defective scar tissue in the process.

        The liver surface can be irregular and hard with scar tissue forming bridges between areas of liver that are still working normally. Under a microscope, collagen fibers, or scar tissue, would be seen replacing normal liver cells.

        1. Progressive fatty liver, that is continuing accumulation of fat and inflammation in the liver.

        3. Procedures: If complications arise, like varices (enlarged veins that might bleed), treatments like banding or other surgical interventions could be needed.

        2. Stay hydrated: Drinking enough water helps your liver do its detoxing job.

        3. Get moving: Regular exercise can help improve overall health and reduce fat in the liver.

        4. Try stress management: Practices like yoga, meditation, or even simple deep breathing can reduce stress, which is great for overall health.

        5. Use herbal remedies wisely: Supplements like milk thistle may help, but always check with your doctor first.

        6. Limit toxins: Avoid harsh chemicals, pesticides, or smoking.

        7. Get good sleep: Your body, including your liver, heals best when youâ€™re well-rested.

        8. Find support: Whether itâ€™s a therapist, a support group, or a close friend, having someone to lean on can make a big difference.
